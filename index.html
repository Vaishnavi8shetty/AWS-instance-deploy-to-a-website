        <h2>Steps to build the project</h2>
        <h3>Step 1. Launch and EC2 instance</h3>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/kypzYsV/instance.png">
         <p>Begin by logging into the AWS Management Console and navigating to the EC2 service.
         Launch a new EC2 instance by> selecting an appropriate Amazon Machine Image (AMI),
         choosing the instance type,configuring instance details such as network settings and storage,
          and finally, creating or selecting a security group to allow inbound HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic.</p>
          <h3>Step 2.Connect to Your Instance</h3>
          <img src="https://i.ibb.co/KN9dqzv/connect.png">
          <p>Once your instance is running, connect to it using SSH (Secure Shell) from your local machine. You'll use the private key associated with your chosen key pair to authenticate.</p>
          <h3>Step 3.Install Required Software</h3>
         <img src="https://i.ibb.co/B2NsVWp/mobcterm.png">
          <p>MobaXterm is a comprehensive remote computing tool for Windows that integrates various network tools into a single application. It combines a terminal emulator, X server, SSH client, and other network tools into one package,
             providing a convenient way to access remote systems and perform various tasks.MobaXterm comes with a built-in SSH client that allows users to securely connect to remote servers and transfer files using the SSH protocol. 
             It supports various authentication methods, including password authentication, public-key authentication, and keyboard interactive authentication.
             Enter the IP address of the remote host and provide the username specified in the EC2 instance connect section.</p>

            <p>Click on "Use private key" and add the key that was created for the instance.Then click ok</p>
        <h3>Step 4.Run command lines</h3>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/VDwkjP9/Screenshot-2024-05-23-164247.png">
        <b><p>1.sudo su</p>
        <p>2.yum update -y</p>
        <p>3.yum install httpd -y</p></b>
        <p>wait until it gets installed</p>
        <p>In the above terminal httpd is already installed in my server</p>
        <h3>Step 5.Upload Website Files</h3>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/441D983/Screenshot-2024-05-23-170503.png">
        <p>Transfer your website's files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) to your EC2 instance. 
        You can use SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) to securely transfer files from your local machine to the instance.
        Alternatively, you can create a file within the directory /var/www/httpd.
        <h3>Step 6.Configure Web Server</h3>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/mF9qTpz/Screenshot-2024-05-23-171618.png">
        <b><p>command -service httpd start</p></b>
        <p>Now, open a new tab and enter the IP address of the instance.</p>

        <p>Once everything is set up, test your website to ensure that it's functioning correctly. Check for any errors or issues and make necessary adjustments.</p>
